```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Import Data

The data came from ????

```{r cars}
airqualitybeijing.csv <- "/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/China_air_pollution_COVID/beijing-air-quality.csv"
#airqualitybeijing.csv = "/home/CAMPUS/dapa2019/R/China_air_pollution_COVID/beijing-air-quality.csv"

AQbeijing <- read.csv(airqualitybeijing.csv)

str(AQbeijing)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(AQbeijing$pm10)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
