Goals

Determine if air pollutants are significantly different during lockdowns vs. not during lockdowns

Determine windows of analysis (what are pre and post lockdown, literature review of how others conduct similar analyses, and what stats they use. See previous similar research.)

Find what data are available (how accurate is data collection? what questions can be asked: proximity to factories, urban vs. rural)

contact Chinese air quality specialists, to ensure I am not misusing data. See Keck sciences: Franc.
